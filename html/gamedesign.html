                        <h2>Random Defense Game</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Random Defense is, as the name suggests, a game where you defend using units that are randomly given to you. It first gained huge popularity in both America and Korea through StarCraft's custom maps, and has since been transformed into various versions, still loved today. So, why is Random Defense so popular?</p>
                    
                    <p>The first reason is the fun of probability-based games. There's a thrill when you manage to get a high-tier unit by breaking through low odds when drawing a unit. The system of gathering gold to use for drawing or upgrading units is very intuitive, and features like free draws trigger dopamine. So, the strategy of saving up gold and drawing many units at once with a free draw is quite popular. Of course, there are times when the odds don't work out, and you end up losing all your resources, but this element of 'luck' becomes the driving force that motivates players to try again.</p>
                    
                    <p>The second reason is the strategic element. The game isn't just decided by luck. In defense games, basic strategy is key. For example, deciding when to upgrade, how to position your units, and how to respond during boss battles are all important strategic considerations. Additionally, timing the upgrade of units to higher-tier units, deciding when to save units to summon a commander, and other factors in the game require careful thought. The active exchange of information between players is also a result of this strategic depth.</p>
                    
                    <p>In-game purchases are also a part of mobile games. Many mobile games include in-app purchases, and there are systems where players can earn rewards by watching ads. The system where you can earn more rewards by watching ads triggers dopamine and keeps players engaged. Additionally, there are products related to ad removal and first-purchase events, which encourage players to make purchases in order to receive extra rewards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lastly, communication with players is crucial. Game developers can gain favor by actively reflecting player feedback and quickly updating the game to improve it. Holding user feedback sessions, listening to suggestions, and incorporating improvements can create an environment where players can enjoy the game even more.</p>
                    
                    <p>For this game to be loved for a long time, it is important to quickly address feedback from players, make necessary improvements, and further develop the game's fun.</p>
