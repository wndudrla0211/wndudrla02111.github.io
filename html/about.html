                <p>Since childhood, I've been captivated by the enchanting worlds of animation and games. From the timeless classics of Disney and the masterful storytelling of Studio Ghibli to the diverse realm of Japanese animations, and from traditional board games to cutting-edge video games, I've passionately explored every aspect these two fields had to offer. These immersive experiences have profoundly shaped my perspective on creativity, artistic expression, and the art of storytelling.</p>
                
                <p>The magical movements of animation - how simple lines and colors could breathe life into characters and create entire worlds - combined with the interactive nature of games that allowed players to become part of the story, utterly fascinated me. This fascination naturally evolved into a burning passion for creation. Even in elementary school, I was already expressing my imaginary worlds through character sketches, creating simple flip-book animations, and designing basic game concepts in my notebooks.</p>
                
                <p>This deep affection for both fields naturally guided my career path, leading me to pursue a double major in Game Development and Animation. Both areas deeply appealed to me as powerful mediums for storytelling and artistic expression. Animation offers the ability to bring impossible dreams to life through movement and visual storytelling, while games provide an unique interactive experience that engages audiences in ways no other medium can achieve.</p>

                <p>Currently, I'm channeling this lifelong passion into creating meaningful and immersive content that can touch people's hearts and spark their imagination. Rather than chasing fame or fortune, I'm focused on crafting experiences that resonate with audiences and push the boundaries of both mediums. For me, game development and animation represent an endless journey of discovery and innovation, where each project brings new challenges and opportunities for creative expression. I'm excited to see where this path will lead me and what new possibilities I'll uncover along the way.</p>
